# CohabitateRPG
CohabitateRPG is a HabitRPG clone for roommates, built on Rails and Backbone. It keeps the main functionality of HabitRPG by creating tasks and giving users points for completing them, but adds and removes others. There are no coins, chatrooms, or purchases, but there will be inviting, shared quests, and leaderboards.
